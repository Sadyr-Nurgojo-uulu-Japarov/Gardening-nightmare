# Gardening Nightmare. 

2D game, open world, top-down


## TO DO:

- Player could unlock tiles

- Players collect ressources from the map (stone, trees...) then craft things (house, fence...).

- Player spawn next to his house at spawn.

Day and night states. 
- Day: Make a beautiful garden, grow plants/crops to sell to the market and gain money to plant more.
- Night: Protect your garden at all costs.

- Animals: Could upgrade your garden, give them armor in order to defend the garden
- Buildings: House, fences, more

- Monsters: Zombies moving slowly, low health. The more night survived, the more powerful the zombies are

- Every 10 days or so, your garden can be visited by many people (NPCs) and they can rate your garden out of viability, looks, variety, safety (against zombies)



## Idea/Rules:

- Protect your garden, make it grow, while you're being attacked by monsters.


- Generate map using a seed, perlin noise to make it smooth but random






# NEW GAME IDEAA:

The world is grey, white. No colors. Only the player and a core in the middle. Our goal is to paint the map using the 3 primary colors (red, green, blue). The map could be "infinite" and we gotta color small portions of a map using specific colors. 
We could add an automation system (wires, electricity and logic inside the game)

But at night, grey squares turn into dark, black squares. Same thing as in real life, black absorbs any color they can and we gotta prevent that somehow.

Is this idea fire ?
yes/no

hell yeah
Good idea, I do know a game where the point is to color the map but it is more of an adventure and find the lore game rather than this and there is no logic gameplay.
