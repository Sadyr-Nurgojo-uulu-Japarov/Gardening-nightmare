# Gardening Nightmare. 

2D game, open world, top-down


## TO DO:

Player/Enemy logic
Terrain generation using noise



## Idea/Rules:

- Protect your garden, make it grow, while you're being attacked by monsters.
Day and night states. 
- Day: Make a beautiful garden, grow plants/crops to sell to the market and gain money to plant more.
- Night: Protect your garden at all costs.

- Animals: Could upgrade your garden, give them armor in order to defend the garden
- Buildings: House, fences, more

- Monsters: Zombies moving slowly, low health. The more night survived, the more powerful the zombies are

- Every 10 days or so, your garden can be visited by many people (NPCs) and they can rate your garden out of viability, looks, variety, safety (against zombies)

- Generate map using a seed, perlin noise to make it smooth but random

- Player could unlock tiles
